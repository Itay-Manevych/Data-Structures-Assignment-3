# Assignment 3
Write a program that performs the following actions:
A. Building an array containing 300 random numbers.
B. Building a maximum heap (by implementing an array) from the array obtained in section A.
C. Write an algorithm that receives a heap of size n and number k (it is possible to assume k<<n) and prints the k largest numbers.

Constraints: O(klogk) required efficiency, don't change the heap, the structure can be used O(k) sized helper.
